## Rules for a great git commit message style

Separate subject from body with a blank line
Do not end the subject line with a period
Use the imperative mood in the subject line
Wrap lines at 72 characters
Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made.

### Format

> type([optional scope]): subject
> [optional body]
> [optional footer]

The scope should be the name of the composant affected.

### Examples

> fix(feeds): Fix RSS URLs in generated feeds
> feat(app): Add box to choose font-size & family
> perf: Remove some useless requests in forum
